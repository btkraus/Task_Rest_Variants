function threshold_variant_maps(thresholds,SNRexclusion,absolutethresholds,outputdir,spatialmapslist,workbenchdir,surfdir,SNRpath)

%% Create binarized and unique ID files (and text files with filepaths and subject IDs) for each input variant map
%
% This function reads a text file in the format 'pathtofile subjectid' with
% spaces as delimiters. Then, loads each variant map in the text file and
% thresholds it at the desired thresholds. Both a binarized map (1s and 0s)
% and a uniqueID map (each contiguous variant has a unique identifier) are
% created at each threshold input. Each of these filetypes is saved in a
% separate directory created within the output directory provided, along
% with an associated text file in the same format as the input text file
%
% INPUTS:
%
% -workbenchdir: the filepath to connectome workbench
% -surfdir: the filepath to the directory that has a path to a template for
% the surface of the brain
% -SNRpath: the filepath to the directory that contains the SNR CIFTIs for
% each subject. These files were created by mode 1000 normalizing the
% resting state data for each session within each subject. The mean BOLD
% value for each voxel in each session was calculated, and then this SNR
% value for each voxel was averaged across sessions. This data was then
% transformed to a CIFTI (numvertices x 1) and used for excluding low SNR
% regions (mean signal < 750 after mode 1000 normalization)
% -spatialmapslist: the filepath to the text file that contains a
% filepaths for each variant map and it's associated subject ID (space
% delimited) on each line of the file
% (e.g.,filepath/MSC01.dtseries.nii MSC01)
% -outputdir: the output directory for the thresholded variant files (note
% that subdirectories are created within this directory for the output
% files)
% -thresholds: a vector (or single value) of thresholds to define variants
% for
% -SNRexclusion: toggles whether to exclude low signal regions from
% consideration as variants (set to 1), otherwise allow all vertices to be
% defined as variants (set to 0)
% -absolutethresholds: toggles whether to use an absolute correlation (r)
% value to define variants (set to 1), otherwise thresholds are interpreted
% as the xth lowest percentage of correlation values (set to 0)
%
% -Lhemipath: the filename and extension for the left hemisphere surface
% midthickness GIFTI
% -Rhemipath: the filename and extension for the right hemisphere surface
% midthickness GIFTI
% -SNR_fstring: the filename and extension for the SNR map
%
% OUTPUTS: 
%
% -Binarized Map: A CIFTI file (numvertices x 1) with binarized (0s and 1s)
% values. The 1s correspond to vertices that were defined as variants given
% the inputs provided, and the 0s are vertices which were not defined as
% variants. This map is then used to create a UniqueID map using connectome
% workbench
% -UniqueID Map: A CIFTI file (numvertices x 1) where every contiguous
% parcel (variant) on the surface has been given a unique value (i.e., all
% the number 1s are part of a contiguous parcel that is distinct from all
% the number 2s). This allows easy identification of distinct parcels
% (variants) for further analysis
